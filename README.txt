When running for first time run make.m and then run install.m
Also do the same whenever restarting Matlab.

For getting heart rate data from desired video, add that video to the
'tests' directory and in file heart_rate_from_video.m line 12 mention the 
name of the video instead of face.mp4, then run heart_rate_from_video.m to 
get required graphs, also the modified video will be present in the 
'results' directory

### heart_rate
This code is used to extract the heart rate from an individual using only a
short video clip of the individual. This concept was used in the video 
calling device that our SDSU team developed for West Health Institute. The 
code to take a short video and amplify the skin tone variations to reveal 
the heartbeat was designed by an amazing team at MIT led by Dr. Fr√©do Durand 
and Dr. William T. Freeman. 
[Their project can be found here.](http://people.csail.mit.edu/mrub/vidmag/) 
Our team wanted to use this concept of medical sensing without physical 
contact, and implemented the MIT code. The code provided by them creates an
output video. Further code is needed to extract the heart rate using 
[Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform). 
This code was written to take the center fifth of the frame and average the
intensity of red pixels in that region. This information is then processed 
to find the dominant frequency which can be read as the individual's heart rate. 
Further improvements can be made by incorporating image stabilization or 
face tracking, but for our purpose these were not necessary.


Details for Eulerian Video Magnification:
This package is a MATLAB implementation of our paper

Eulerian Video Magnification for Revealing Subtle Changes in the World
ACM Transaction on Graphics, Volume 31, Number 4 (Proceedings SIGGRAPH
2012)

The paper and example videos can be found on the project web page
http://people.csail.mit.edu/mrub/vidmag/

The code is supplied for educational purposes only. Please refer to the
enclosed LICENSE.pdf file regarding permission to use the software.
Please cite our paper if you use any part of the code or data on the
project web page. Please contact the authors below if you wish to use the
code commercially.

The code includes the following combination of spatial and temporal
filters, which we used to generate all the results in the paper:

	Spatial					Temporal
=========================================================================
	Laplacian pyramid		Ideal bandpass
	Laplacian pyramid		Butterworth bandpass
	Laplacian pyramid		Second-order IIR bandpass
	Gaussian pyramid		Ideal bandpass

The code was written in MATLAB R2011b, and tested on Windows 7, Mac OSX and
Linux. It uses the pyramid toolbox by Eero Simoncelli (matlabPyrTools),
available at http://www.cns.nyu.edu/~eero/software.php.
For convenience, we have included a copy of version 1.4 (updated Dec. 2009)
of their toolbox here.
The code currently also requires MATLAB's Image Processing Toolbox. We hope
to remove this dependency in the future.

To reproduce the results shown in the paper:

1) Download the source videos from the project web page into a directory
"data" inside the directory containing this code.
2) Start up MATLAB and change directory to the location of this code.
3) (Optional) Run "make.m" to build pyramid toolbox libraries (this is 
REQUIRED if using Mac OS and MATLAB newer than 2011b).
4) Run "install.m".
5) Run "reproduceResults.m" to reproduce all the results in the paper.
See the "reproduceResults.m" script for more details.

NOTE: Generating each of the results will take a few minutes. We
have selected parameters that result in better looking videos,
however, depending on your application, you may not need such high
quality results.

The parameters we used to generate the results presented in the
paper can be found in the script "reproduceResults.m". Please refer to the
paper for more detail on selecting the values for the parameters. In some
cases, the parameters reported in the paper do not exactly match the ones
in the script, as we have refined our parameters through experimentation.
Feel free to experiment on your own!
